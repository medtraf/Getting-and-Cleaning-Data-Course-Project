Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

I have written the code without breaking into functions.  Normally, it is a good practice to break it out into functions 
but I think this makes it easier to follow the logic in a linear fashion.

1- Download data into the projectData folder if it doesn't exist. projectData folder is assumed to be created
on the same level as the run_analysis.R script.  If there is already projectData folder, data is not downloaded
and unzipped to it.  I have written this on a windows system, if it makes any difference for the user.

2- The test packages is downloaded and labeled
3- The train package is downloaded and labeled
4- They are merged 
5- They are grouped and summarized
6- The result file is exported
